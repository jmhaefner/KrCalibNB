This is just a list of analysis tags, to keep documented what is going on in each one. Also, some general notes on how things are separated out based on analysis tags.

The template notebooks are called
kr_selection_and_filter_<analysis_tag>_TPLT.ipynb
single_map_correction_<analysis_tag>_TPLT.ipynb

st190819: standard analysis as of 19 Aug 2019. Includes tracking of points where fit failed.
rg190819: standard analysis as of 19 Aug 2019, WITH regularization of lt map points above 8000 us or below 1000 us.
rg_loose_190819: standard analysis as of 19 Aug 2019, WITH regularization of lt map points above 10000 us or below 1000 us.
z_rms: z location of events is determined using the rms of the S2, rather than the spacing between the S1 and the S2.
RdropTest: for understanding why we see a dropoff in the E profile vs R
x2rg190819: regularizing by killing fits with very bad errors (chi2), rather than with very strange values. Then, replace the NaNs with neighborhood averages
x2rgav190819: regularize by killing fits with very bad chi2. Replace NaNs with average value over the entire map
x2rg_wide_190819: regularizing by killing fits with very bad errors (chi2), rather than with very strange values. Then, replace the NaNs with wide neighborhood averages
x2rg_interp_190819: regularizing by killing fits with very bad errors (chi2), rather than with very strange values. Then, replace the NaNs with a polynomial fit over the whole map
